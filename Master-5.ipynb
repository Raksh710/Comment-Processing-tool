The agency  published proposed revisions in the November 13, 2019, Federa l Register at 84 Fed. Reg. 61,684 and is accepting comments at Docket No. EPA -HQ-OW-2017 -0300 .   EDF’s mission is to preserve the natural systems on which all life depends. We have more than two million members and a staff of 700 scientists, economists, policy experts, and other professionals around the world. Guided by science and economics, we find practical and lasting solutions to the most serious environmental problems. Thi s has drawn us to areas that span the biosphere: climate, oceans, ecosystems and health. Our Health Program seeks to safeguard human health by reducing exposure to toxic chemicals and pollution, including accelerating LSL replacement to reduce lead in drin king water.   I. Summary of Comments and Recommended Changes to Proposed Rule   In this comment, we are focused on changes that EPA should to make to the definition of an LSL, the requirements for water systems to develop LSL inventories, and the notificati on of individual consumers who are drinking water that passes through a n LSL . We will address other issues in separate comments.   EPA’s proposed change to the current definition of an LSL at 40 CFR § 141.2 is flawed because it continues to exempt goosenecks, pigtails, or other connectors made of lead. These connectors are a major  source of lead in drinking water not just because they  are made of lead, but because they can release significant amounts of lead particulate into water as they flex with temperature , are scoured by turbulent water flow, and as other conditions change.   The exemption of these connectors from the definition o f an LSL would render a water system’s LSL inventory and periodic notices to customers misleading because service lines described as “non -lead” may   Page 2  actually have some lead pipe in them. This will give residents a false sense of security. We recommend that the agency modify the proposed definition by deleting the exemption and explicitly stating that goosenecks, pigtails and connectors made of lead are LSLs.   With regard to a service line inventory, we share EPA’s view that an LSL inventory is a critical as pect of an overall program designed to reduce lead in drinking water. A good inventory can better inform decision -making and priority setting not only by the water system and the state, but also homeowners and others  who drink the water that passes through  the LSL.   In general, we support EPA’s approach to developing and communicating an LSL inventory at § 141.84(a), particularly:  \\uf0b7 Explicitly including the entire service line regardless of ownership;  \\uf0b7 Including “unknown” along with “lead” and “non -lead” as r eporting categories for the inventory;  \\uf0b7 Requiring a “location identifier” for each LSL;  \\uf0b7 Requiring that the inventory be made publicly accessible and, for systems serving more than 100,000 persons, also electronically available; and  \\uf0b7 Requiring that the inve ntory be updated at least annually.   We recommend that EPA make several changes to the proposed inventory requirements to strengthen the approach and improve the effectiveness of the final rule. Specifically, we ask that the agency modify the proposed rul e by:  \\uf0b7 Allowing state s to identify a dditional sources of information for categorizing service lines without modifying their version of the LCR ; \\uf0b7 Recognizing the uncertainties in the assignment  of each service line to the “lead” and “non -lead” categories by explicitly providing criteria – such as 90% confidence – to the decision ; \\uf0b7 Making it clear that each service line must be categorized; and  \\uf0b7 Directing the state to make the locations of LSLs pub licly accessible and integrate the inventories into an online tool.   Finally, the proposed rule requiring water systems to notify each consumer who drinks water that passes through an LSL needs to  be clarified. The proposal would require notification to a wide -ranging list of people, from tenants in residential units, to office tenants, to restaurant patrons, to children at a child care facility . We recommend that EPA carefully consider how different types of water systems should notify consumers in the most common situations and create explicit requirements for these water systems to provide the most effective notices.     II.  Lead Service Line Definition – Recommended Changes and Reasoning   EPA’s proposed change to the current definition of an LSL at 40 CFR § 141.2 is flawed. Without explanation or justification, the agency continues to exempt goosenecks, pigtails, or other connectors made of lead. These connectors are a significant source of  lead in drinking water not just because they are made of lead, but because they are designed to flex when the main under the street contracts or expands along its axis with changing temperatures. The flexing undermines the protective coating provided by corrosion control and can release lead particulate into the water. The agency acknowledges the risk at proposed § 141.84(c) by requiring water systems to replace the connectors when they encounter those that they own  during emergency repairs or planned wate r system infrastructure work.   As a result of the exemption of these connectors from the definition of an LSL, a water system’s LSL inventory and periodic notices to customers will be misleading because service lines described as “non -  Page 3  lead” may actually ha ve lead pipe in them. This will give r esidents a false sense of security. We recommend that the agency modify the proposed definition by replacing the last sentence as follows:   Lead service line means a service line made of lead , which connects the water main to the building inlet. A lead service line may be owned by the water system, owned by the property owner, or both. For the purposes of this subpart, a galvanized service line is considered a lead service line if it ever was or is currently downstream of any lead service line or service line of unknown material. It includes a gooseneck, pigtail or connector made of lead , even where there is no other lead pipe in the service line . If the only lead piping serving the home or building is a lead gooseneck, pigtail, or connector, and it is not a galvanized service line that is considered an LSL the service line is not a lead service line.   To understand why our recommended change is critical, we explain: A) the problem with the current LSL definition; B) how EPA’s  proposed change to the definition does not adequately address that problem; C) how Congress and other states that have considered the definition of an LSL have addressed  it; and D) how our recommendation addresses the problem in a manner consistent with the rule’s goal.   A) The problems with the current LSL definition   EPA’s current definition of an LSL at § 141.2 says:    Lead service line means a service line made of lea d which connects the water main to the building inlet and any lead pigtail, gooseneck or other fitting which is connected to such lead line.   While it is not obvious, the current definition exempts service lines that have lead goosenecks, pigtails, or other fittings as long as the remainder of the line is not made of lead. If the composition of the remainder of the line is unknown or a material other than lead, the entire service line would not be an LSL even though it contains lead pipe.   The confusion results partly from EPA’s failure in the current rule to define a “service line.” The agency implicitly treats these short sections of piping, usually one to two feet long that are directly connected to the drinking water main , as not part of  the service line and, therefore, not part of an LSL. They appear to fall in a definitional gap between the main and the service line. We think these connectors are properly considered as part of the service line.   The primary purpose of goosenecks, pigta ils, and similar connectors is to allow  the service line to flex in response to subtle movements between the rigid main (often ductile  iron) under the street and a rigid service line (typically galvanized steel) that connect at right angles. These subtle movements can occur for a variety of reasons, most commonly as the temperature of water in the pipe changes. An increasing temperature will cause the pipe to expand. A dropping temperature will do the opposite. Fo r short runs of pipe, the changes are not particularly important. But for a main under a long street, they add up to significant movement along the axis of the main. Connections between mains are designed to accommodate these shifts. When a lead gooseneck,  pigtail, or other connector flexes, it is likely to release lead into drinking water going to the home or building, especially in particulate form, as the protective coating from corrosion control is disturbed.   B) How the proposed change to the definiti on does not adequately address that problem   In its proposed revisions to the LCR, EPA adopts a definition of LSLs as follows:   Lead service line  means a service line made of lead , which connects the water main to the building inlet  and any lead pigtail, g ooseneck or other fitting which is connected to such lead line .   Page 4  A lead service line may be owned by the water system, owned by the property owner, or both. For the purposes of this subpart, a galvanized service line is considered a lead service line if it ever was or is currently downstream of any lead service line or service line of unknown material. If the only lead piping serving the home or building is a lead gooseneck, pigtail, or connector, and it is not a galvanized service line that is considered an  LSL the service line is not a lead service line.   While EPA did not define a “service line” in its proposed rule, it did add helpful and appropriate definitions of a gooseneck, pigtail, or connector and of a galvanized service line to  § 141.2 .  Gooseneck,  pigtail or connector is a short section of piping, usually one to two feet long, which can be bent and used for connections between rigid service piping.   Galvanized service line generally means iron or steel piping that has been dipped in zinc to prevent  corrosion and rusting.   The proposed change to the LSL definition would continue to exempt lead goosenecks, pigtails, and connectors. However, it appears to narrow the exemption if the device is upstream of a galvanized service line. This change is good b ut insufficient. It is also confusing because it uses the term LSL in the definition of LSL creating what appears to be circular logic.   In the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency provides no explanation for the change to the LSL definition or what alternatives it considered. Nonetheless, the agency clearly recognizes that lead goosenecks, pigtails, and connectors are a significant source of lead in drinking water. Proposed § 141.84(c) requires that “[t]he water system must replace any lead gooseneck , pigtail or connector it owns when encountered during emergency repairs or planned water system infrastructure work” regardless of the system’s 90th percentile lead level.   The agency justifies this requirement to replace these connectors by stating that :  EPA expects that mandatory replacement of these connectors as they are encountered would provide a beneficial and lower burden opportunity for the water system to remove a lead source from its distribution system. The water system is encouraged but not required to engage with the customer to coordinate replacement of a customer -owned lead gooseneck, pigtail, or connector; however, the water system would not be required to bear the cost of replacement of the customer -owned materials under this proposal. R eplacement of a lead gooseneck, pigtail, or connector regardless of ownership would not count towards goal -based or mandatory LSLR rates.1  The agency explains that “[t]his proposed requirement was recommended by the National Drinking Water Advisory Counci l (NDWAC, 2015).”2 However, NDWAC’s Lead and Copper Rule Work Group Report actually  said that EPA’s revisions to the LCR should include “ Modifying the definition of lead service lines to include any service line where any portion, including a lead pigtail, gooseneck or other fitting, is made of lead.”3 The requirement falls short of including all of these connectors in the definition of an LSL.   C) How Congress and other states that have considered the definition of an LSL have addressed  it                                                          1 84 Federal Register 61697.  2 84 Federal Register 61697.  3 NDWAC Lead and Copper Rule Work Group August 2015 Report  which was incorporated by re ference into NDWAC’s December 2015 recommendations .    Page 5  In 2017, Congress implicitly rejected the exemption for lead goosenecks, pigtails, and other fittings from the definition of an LSL when it enacted the  Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act (P.L. No. 114 -322). Section 2105(b)(4) of WIIN4 established a broad definition of an LSL for purposes of a grant progr am for lead reduction projects. The definition states that:   The term ‘lead service line ’ means a pipe and its fittings, which are not lead free (as defined in section 1417(d)), that connect the drinking water main to the building inlet.   By referencing Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) , Congress’ definition of an LSL includes any service line fitting that contains more than 0.2 percent lead in solder and flux or has a weighted average of more than 0.25 percent lead in the wetted surfaces of pipes, pipe fittings, plumbing fittings, and fixtures. Congress’ defi nition would include copper service lines with lead solder installed before 1986 and any service line that contains a brass or bronze valve with more than 0.25% installed before 2014.   Two states, Michigan and California , that have explicitly considered t he scope of LSLs have included lead goosenecks, pigtails and other connectors in the definition of an LSL. We recommend that EPA follow the lead of Michigan and California.   \\uf0b7 Michigan: In 2018, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy significantly strengthened its LCR. The rules at R 325.10105 (r) define an LSL to mean “either a service line which is made of lead or any lead pigtail, lead gooseneck, or other lead fitting that is connected to the service line, or both.”  \\uf0b7 California:  The California Water Board defines a user service line5 to mean pipe, tube, and fittings connecting a water main to an individual water meter or service connection. In 2016, the California legislature adopted Senate Bill 1398  that required community water systems to compile an inventory of lead user service lines in use in its distribution system and submit it to the Water Board. The Water Board provided guidance to community water systems6 that explicitly includes in the definition of a lead user service line any fittings made of lead and provides goosenecks and pigtails as examples.  It exempted brass and bronze fittings because they are not lead and did the same for solder in copper pipe because it is not a fitting.   We note that the Illinois legislature may have considered the issue when it enacted in 2017 Senate Enrolled Act 5507 requiring community water systems to submit a “water distribution system inventory” to Illinois EPA  (IEPA)  in 2018 and update it annually thereafter. IEPA posts the inventory reports online  and provides guidance  for systems to prepare the reports. The Illinois law and the guidance do not address the issue of whether lead goosenecks, pigtails and other connectors are part of the LSL. Presumably, the state uses the curren t federal definition of an LSL.   In addition, as noted earlier, EPA’s NDWAC recommended that the agency should revise the LCR by “Modifying the definition of lead service lines to include any service line where any portion, including a lead pigtail, goosen eck or other fitting, is made of lead.”8                                                          4 Adds new section 1495B to the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Page 6  D) How our recommendation addresses the problem in a manner consistent with the rule’s goal   Rather than a confusing last sentence in the definition of an LSL at § 141.2, EPA should delete the sentence and replace it with one that says , “It includes a gooseneck, pigtail or connector made of lead , even where there is no other lead pipe in the service line .” This sentence would make clear that EPA is eliminating the current rule’s exemption for these connectors and av oid the potential confusion.   With this change, water systems must:  \\uf0b7 Categorize all lead goosenecks, pigtails, or connectors as “lead” instead of “non -lead” for purposes of the LSL inventory at § 141.84(a)(3) that must be made publicly a ccessible  pursuant to § 141.84(a)(6);  \\uf0b7 Explicitly describe their operating procedures for these connectors in their LSL replacement plan pursuant to § 141.84(b);  \\uf0b7 Notify the following that they have these lead connections, pursuant to § 141.85(e):  o Consumers annually by mail or  other approved means;  o New customers at the time of service initiation; and  o Consumers when there is  a disturbance to the connector.   We recognize that this change would increase the number of LSLs that must be replaced pursuant to 40 CFR § 141.84. However, as we will explain in other comments, that issue is best resolved  by strengthening the proposed rule’s requirements to replace LSLs.     III. Lead Service Line Inventory – Recommended Changes and Reasoning   We share EPA’s view that an LSL inventory is a critical aspect of an overall program designed to reduce lead in drinking water. A good inventory can better inform decision -making and priority setting by not just the water system, but also the state, homeow ners, and others  who drink the water that passes through the LSL.   In general, we support EPA’s approach to developing and communicating an LSL inventory at § 141.84(a), especially:  \\uf0b7 Explicitly including the entire service line regardless of ownership;  \\uf0b7 Including “unknown” along with “lead” and “non -lead” as reporting categories for the inventory;  \\uf0b7 Requiring a “location identifier” for each LSL;  \\uf0b7 Requiring that the inventory be made publicly accessible and, for systems serving more than 100,000 persons, also electronically available; and  \\uf0b7 Requiring that the inventory be updated at least annually.   We recommend that EPA make changes to the proposed inventory requirements to strengthen the approach and improve the effectiveness of the final rule. Specifically, we ask that the agency modify the proposed rule by:  \\uf0b7 Allowing state s to identify a dditional sources of information for categorizing service lines without modifying their version of the LCR ; \\uf0b7 Recognizing the uncertainties in the designation of each service line to the “lead” and “non -lead” categories by explicitly providing criteria – such as 90% confidence – to the designation;  \\uf0b7 Making it clear that each service line must be categorized; and  \\uf0b7 Directing the state to make the locations of LSLs pub licly accessib le and integrate the inventories into an online tool.   We explore each of these recom mendations in more detail below.    Page 7   A) Allowing state s to identify  additional sources of information  for categorizing service lines without modifying their  version of the LCR   We agree with EPA’s approach in § 141.84(a)(2) of explicitly requiring water systems to consider three types of information sources to develop the inventory: 1) plumbing codes, permits, and records in the files of the building departments; 2) water system records; and 3) inspection and records of the distribution system.   We also support EPA’s decision in § 141.84(a)(2)(iv) to allow the state to require additional resources. However, the word “requirement” indicates it must be in the state’s version of the  LCR. We encourage, EPA to replace “required by the State” with “provided  or required  by the State .” This change will make it easier for the state drinking water agency to systematically implement the lessons learned from the annual inventory updates submi tted by water systems as well as incorporate evolving tools to assess and categorize service lines.   (a)(2)(iv): Any resource provided or required  by the State to assess service line materials for structures built prior to 1989.   B) Recognizing the uncertain ties in the designation of each service line to the “lead” and “non -lead” categories by explicitly providing criteria – such as 90% confidence – to the designation   One significant concern we have with the process EPA proposes that water systems must use t o develop the inventory is how it handles the inherent uncertainties with designating a service line as “lead” or “non -lead” pursuant to § 141.84(a)(3). With the tools we currently have available, unless a water system excavates the entire service line, it  cannot know its composition with absolute certainty. We think that it is impractical for a water system to conduct these excavations for each service line, especially when the excavation disturbs the LSL and may result in increased exposure to lead partic ulate in consumer’s drinking water. It would also be counterproductive to categorize all service lines as “unknown” because of the uncertainty .  EPA acknowledges the challenge in the preamble when it stated that:   This requirement follows the recommendation provided to the EPA by the NDWAC, to grant water systems the flexibility to create an inventory that allows for the uncertainty of service line materials that cannot be verified by records or other means within three years, while at the same  time ensuring that consumers potentially served by an LSL are provided adequate protections.9  However, we do not think the agency has adequately addressed the issue in its proposed rule. We think that EPA should explicitly provide standard performance -based criteria for designating a service line as “lead” or “non -lead.” This approach would:  \\uf0b7 Allow utilities to take advantage of statistical models that predict the likelihood of an individual service line being lead or non -lead;  \\uf0b7 Provide a standard measure f or all utilities to make the designation; and  \\uf0b7 Better communicate to customers, consumers, residents, and the public the uncertainties that underlie the designation so they are prepared if an LSL ends up not being lead after all or that a service line desig nated as non -lead ends up having a portion that is  lead.                                                           9 84 Federal Register 61696.    Page 8  We suggest that 90% confidence would be a reasonable criteri on at this time but recognize that EPA may want to modify it in the future. Therefore, we recommend that EPA insert a new paragraph after  § 141.84(a)(3) as follows:   (4) A service line must be designated as lead in subparagraph (3)(i) or non -lead in subparagraph (3)(ii) if the water system is 90 percent confident that the designation is appropriate. The designation may be based on a statist ical analysis  of the information gathered in paragraph (2).  Consistent with this change, paragraph (b) should be modified so the water system would be required to explain how it made the designation. Specifically, we recommend:   Lead service line replacement plan. All water systems with lead service lines in their distribution system shall, by [INSERT DATE 3 YEARS AFTER PUBLICATION OF FINAL RULE IN FEDERAL REGISTER], submit a lead service line replacement plan and lead service lin e inventory to the primacy agency described in paragraph (a) of this section. The plan must include a description of resources and methods used to designate service lines as lead or non -lead; procedures to conduct full lead service line replacement, a stra tegy for informing customers before a full or partial lead service line replacement, a lead service line replacement goal rate in the event of a lead trigger level exceedance, a pitcher filter tracking and maintenance system, a procedure for customers to f lush service lines and premise plumbing of particulate lead, and a funding strategy for conducting lead service line replacements.    C) Making it clear that each service line must be categorized   We are concerned that proposed paragraph (3) in § 141.84(a) does not explicitly require that the water system categorize each service line into one of the three categories. While the preamble conveys this point, we think it is important to be clear.   Simi larly, § 141.84(a)(6) requires that the LSL inventory be made publicly accessible, but only requires that the location of LSLs be identified. We recommend that it explicitly include “unknown” lines. The recommended changes are as follows:   (3) The initial inventory must include all service lines connected to the public water distribution system regardless of ownership status (e.g., where service line ownership is shared, the inventory would include both the portion of the service line owned by the water sys tem and the customer - owned portion of the service line). Each service line Service lines  shall be categorized in the following manner:   (6) (i)  The inventory must include a location identifier, such as a street, intersection, or landmark, served by each  service line categori zed as lead or unknown in paragraph (3).lead service line.    D) Directing the state to make the locations of LSLs publicly a ccessible  and integrate the inventories into an online tool   Given the variety and capability of water systems across the country and within a state, we think it would be beneficial and appropriate for the state to also make the inventory, including the location identifier, publicly a ccessible . While this could happen  through requests filed by citizens pursuant  to state public   Page 9  records and state Freedom of Information Act requirements , we recommend that EPA make it explicit in order to enable the public  to get the information when the water system is unwilling to make it readily accessible.   We also think EPA should  direct the states to integrate the location information from the inventories into an online tool that the public could more easily use. An integrated inventory would also benefit the state in assessing the need and setting priorities. It would also reduce  the burden on small systems in responding to requests from the public, such as prospective home buyers or renters, for information on the presence of an LSL at specific location s.   Therefore,  we recommend that § 142.16(d) that addresses requirements for states to adopt 40 CFR Part 141, Subpart I – Control of Lead and Copper be modified to include a new subparagraph as follows:   (d)(9) Section 141.84(a) — Ensuring the lead service line inventories are publicly a ccessible  through an integrated, on -line, pub licly-accessible tool.    IV.  Consumer Notice of LSL s – Recommended Changes and Reasoning   EPA’s proposed revisions to the LCR would require water systems to deliver many notices to its customers and consumers. Some of those notices are broad public education and others are very specific. In this comment, we are focused on the four types of notice s that must be deliver ed to customers who own service lines of lead or unknown material o r to consumers who drink water th at passes through these lines and how they can be clarified to be more useful.   A) Varying difficulties in reaching four types of people who must be notified of LSLs   EPA’s proposed revisions to §§ 141.84 and 85 require a variety of notices to be delivered to four categories of people directly affected by a service line with lead or unknown material: 1) customers; 2) owners of service lines; 3) residents; and 4) consumers. Each type represents a progressively difficult challenge for water systems to identify and notify as discussed below:    1. Customers: Proposed § 141.2 defines a customer as a person who is “a paying user of a public water system.”  While EPA’s preamble to the proposed rule often discusses customers as if they are homeowners, the term would include those who own schools, child care facilities, restaurants, office buildings, government operations, and industrial operations. Homeowners are only a subset, albeit an important one, of total customers a water system m ay have. Despite the variety, because the water system has a financial relationship with a customer, we would not expect it to have any difficulty providing required notices in a timely manner.  2. Owners of service lines: The proposed rule does not define who  owns a service line.10 The preamble usually equates customers and owners of service lines as the same. While that is likely the most common scenario, there may be variations. For purposes of this comment, we assume that the owner of the service line is also the customer.  3. Resid ents: The proposed rule does not define “resident ,” so we presume it means a person  living in housing that is more than a hotel. Several provisions of the rule would require a water system to notify residents of various information such as tap sampling and  LSL disturbances it conducts. A water system may elect to post the information at a conspicuous location instead of providing                                                         10 At 84 Federal Register 6 1697, EPA states that “This section must also include a clear explanation of how the water system defines ownerships of lead service lines, who has financial responsibility for the replacement, and the legal basis for that determination.” However, we were unable to identify the specific requirement to provide that explanation. We would support such a requirement in the LSL replacement plan requirements at § 141.84(b).    Page 10  individual notification to all residents. Given the narrow circumstances for this notice, we assume that water systems will not h ave a significant difficulty providing required notices in a timely manner.  4. Consumers: Proposed § 141.2 defines consumers to mean “ customers and other users of a public water system.” The definition is broad and would include residents in housing, patrons in restaurants or stores, tenants in office buildings, children at child  care facilities, students at schools, and employees in a workplace. As discussed below, in certain cases the se consumers  will be difficult to identify and hard to adequately notify, e specially when they are transient.    B) Requirement to notify “consumers” who use water from LSLs   Proposed § 141.85(e) would require  water systems to annually notify each consumer who is expected to drink water that has passed through an LSL . A consumer must be notified within 30 days of completion of the initial LSL inventory required by proposed § 141.84(a). The consumer must receive annual updates thereafter until the customer (the person paying the water bill) no longer has a n LSL. The notic e must  be delivered by mail or another method approved by the primacy agency.   For consumers with a confirmed LSL, proposed § 141.85(e)(3)(i) requires that the notice include:  \\uf0b7 A statement that the consumer’s service line is lead;  \\uf0b7 An explanation of the h ealth effects of lead;  \\uf0b7 Steps consumers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water;  \\uf0b7 Information about opportunities to replace lead service lines;  \\uf0b7 Information about programs that provide innovative financing solutions to assist consumers with replacement of their portion of a lead service line; and  \\uf0b7 A statement that the water system is required to replace its portion of a lead service line when the consumer notifies the water system that  they are replacing their owned portion of the lead service line.   For customers , but not other consumers, with a service line of unknown material that may be lead, proposed § 141.85(e)(3)(ii) requires that the notice include:  \\uf0b7 A statement that the customer’s service line is of unknown material that may be lead;  \\uf0b7 An explanation of the health effects of lead;  \\uf0b7 Steps customers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water; and  \\uf0b7 Information about opportunities to verify the material of the service line.   In addition, proposed § 141.85(e)(5) would require that a  water system notify a consumer of water passing through an LSL whenever they cause a disturbance to the LSL that results in the water being shut off. The notice must happen before the water is turned back on. If the disturbance involves replacement of a w ater meter; lead gooseneck, pigtail, or connector; or any portion of the lead pipe, the water system must also provide consumers with:  \\uf0b7 A pitcher filter certified to remove lead;  \\uf0b7 Instructions to use the filter; and  \\uf0b7 Three months of filter replacement cartri dges.   C) EPA’s reasoning for requiring each consumer be notified   In the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA explains that its notice to consumers  will empower  them  to take action to reduce exposure and prompt communication between occupants and landlords to replace LSLs. Specifically, EPA made the following statements:     Page 11  The EPA believes that these proposed notification requirements have value for both occupants of rental properties as well as homeowners. Information regarding the existence of an LSL will provide important information for renters on potential lead exposure in their home and could prompt a communication with their landlord regarding lead service line r eplacement. Occupants of rental properties will also benefit from the information on other actions they can take to reduce lead exposure in drinking water. The CWS must provide the same information noted above and include an invitation to participate in th e LSLR program and repeat the notice annually until it is at or below the lead trigger level.11   Moreover, an LSL inventory will lead to increased awareness of consumers regarding whether they are served by an LSL, which could improve public health protection if affected consumers take action to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water .12  For e xample, consumers will learn from their water system if they are served by an LSL, about the risks of lead in drinking water, and about the actions they can take to reduce lead in drinking water and remove their LSL. Some of these customers are expected to  voluntarily initiate LSLR, regardless of the water system’s 90th percentile lead level. These provisions are expected to result in approximately 214,000 to 350,000 LSLRs over the next 35 years.13   D) Recommendation to clarify how the notices to consumers must be delivered   We agree with EPA ’s assessment of the value of these notices and encourage the agency to keep them in a final rule. EDF has published two behavioral studies demonstrating the value  of and assessing best practices for disclosing the prese nce of LSLs to potential homebuyers and renters.14,15 For reference, we have added those studies to the docket.   However, we are concerned that in its proposed rule, EPA has not fully explained how the notices will be delivered. For example, annual mailings make no sense for a transient population. In addition, water systems may not have a means to notify occupants and residents in situations where it is not entering the property. They also may lack the authority to require property owners to provide contact lists or post notices in conspicuous locations for residents and occupants to read.   We recommend that EPA carefully consider how different types of water systems should notify consumers in the most common situations and create incentives for these water systems to provide the most effective notices.    V. Conclusion   In this comment, we ask that EPA consider our recommendations to improve the LCR by:  \\uf0b7 Modifying the definition of an LSL to explicitly include a gooseneck, pigtail, or connector made of lead. This change will avoid misleading consumers that service lines designated as “non -lead”                                                         11 84 Federal Register 61702.  12 84 Federal Register 61695.  13 84 Federal Register 61700.  14 Lu, H., Romero -Canyas, R., Hiltner, S., Neltner, T.,  McCormick, L., and Niederdeppe, J.

       "'national primary drinking water regulations: proposed lead and copper rule revisions, docket no. epa –hq–ow- - dear administrator wheeler : the district of columbia water and sewer authority (dc water) appreciates the u.s. environmental protection agency’s efforts to revise the lead and copper rule. removing lead service lines is a tremendous effort and water systems cannot do so alone. dc water believes epa has taken important steps to put forward a revised rule framework that addresses many stakeholder concerns. we provided detailed comments on several rule provisi ons that would be challenging for water systems and regulators to implement. we hope that these comments will help epa finalize the rule expeditiously. sincerely, david l. gadis ceo & general manager epa proposed lcr revis ions - docket id no. epa -hq-ow- - district of columbia water and sewer authority comments page corrosion control epa described optimization and re -optimization studies in . that have minimal difference in terms of research effort , time required for the water system to complete , and time for the state to review them. the specified time for study completion within months is insufficient. we suggest changing the re -optimization study to a desktop study that evaluates current operations and lead results. the water sys tem may conclude from the desktop study that a coupon or full pipe loop study is need to evaluate changes in treatment and specify the time period for the plan, design, construction, operation, and analyses of the coupons or pipe loops. a water treatment study that includes water testing should include water testing for a minimum of full year to evaluate seasonal effects. the study design and construction will require months minimum, but often longer for construction if space and lead service lines ar e not readily available. for example, lead service lines should be carefully extracted from a fully excavated trench. this activity cannot be done during freezing temperature months or rain. pipe loop scales need to acclimate for after at least year of routine operation to provide meaningful results . epa should account for at least years in their time to comply with any study requiring a pipe loop . . (a)(iii) - the proposed rule grants the state the discretion to require a water system to re-optimization study if the ir th percentile is between - ppb lead. the regulation does not consider the source of elevated lead , which can be from a localized source due to household plumbing, including galvanized iron seeded with lead, fixtures, or lead solder that the rule’s prescribed treatment techniques are not designed to control or reduce the release of lead into water . the option for a corrosion control study at these lower levels should be determined by the water system as they have many ot her competing treatment and infrastructure needs to balance . dc water recommends including data review and source assessment prior to initiating a re -optimization study. . (c)( ) - the proposed rule requires the water system to evaluate mg/l and mg/l doses of orthophosphate. corrosion control treatment varies considerably based on numerous factors. the rule should provide more flexibility for water systems to design the study that is appropriate for their system based on their source water quality, treatment plant operation , distribution system materials, and wastewater effluent needs. based on dc water’s experience , the higher dose of . mg/l produce d an iron -phosphate -aluminum complex that made the water an opaque white color [insert reference] . we reduced the dose to . mg/l which eliminated the white water and effectively reduced lead levels (our recent th percentile lead level was ppb). dc water recommends removing the specified orthophosphate do se levels from the rule. . (j) - the proposed rule requires a “find -and-fix assessment” for tap samples > ppb , which includes adding the monitoring areas to the water quality parameter (wqp) required routine monitoring. dc water recommends the single home assessment focus on customer engagement, identifying the lead sources for the individual home, and provid ing information to the owner about mitigation options. individual home investigations should not automatically feed into system -wide corrosion control assessments. corrosion control assessments must include epa proposed lcr revis ions - docket id no. epa -hq-ow- - district of columbia water and sewer authority comments page trending and larger system -level data rather than a single home. we strongly encourage epa to remove the added wqp routine monitoring requirements. . (j)( ) - the proposed rule requires the water system to “sample a new water quality parameter site that is on the same size water main in the same pressure zone and located within a half mile of the location of the action level exceedance within days of receiving the sample result s.” identifying a sample tap in a residential neighborhood, within ½ mile of a home, and has access for routine regulatory sampling would be incredibly challenging. dc water recommends epa state the objectives of corrosion control monitoring and provide g uidance how to select sites rather than require specific characteristics that are not implementable or result in not meeting the intended objective. the follow -up should also not require water testing (lead or wqp) in all cases. for example, the water s ystem might have previously investigated the home with an earlier exceedance and found galvanized iron pipe inside the home. other common causes of exceedances dc water observes is when customer’s collect a sample when the home has been vacant for months o r during a kitchen remodel. follow -up wat er testing is not beneficial until the home is occupied and not undergoing construction. lead service line replacement . (d)( ) and ( ) – the proposed rule require s the water system to replace the lead service line it owns within days when it is notified that a customer has replaced the customer -owned portion. a specified time period in the rule does not account for the water systems’ other operation and construct ion needs, such as scheduled water main replacements that will include service line replacements. a specified time period also does not account for weather/climate periods when excavation work should not be conducted . many water utilities do not do any pla nned construction between november and march . dc water does not do replacement work during rain or snow due to increased hazards of trench collapse. based on dc water’s experience implementing our voluntary lead service line replacement program , we determined the coordination with customers causes significant time delays due to their lack of owner availability and interest to meet with the contractor, apprehension around the disruption of the construction, and others issues . dc water recommend s that the regulation not specify a time period for completing these replacements and instead require water systems to include in the lsr plan procedure s for addressing the ir response to notices of completed lead service line replacement s. . (e) – the proposed rule requires the water system to notify the property owner and non -owner residents “within hours of the [full lead service line ] replacement. ” the regulation is confusing because it is not clear whether the water system is required to provid ed the notice hours before replacement starts or within hours after the replacement is completed. dc water notif ies the customer hours in advance for any water shut -off. in addition, notice is left at the home after completion of any lead service line replacemen t. dc water recommends epa revise the notification requirement to be delivered to the residents within hours of complet ing a lead service line replacement. dc water also recommends the epa proposed lcr revis ions - docket id no. epa -hq-ow- - district of columbia water and sewer authority comments page requirement to notify the homeowner be re moved from regulation. water systems have difficulty notifying non -resident owners. dc water’s experience of lead service line replacements for rental units focuses communication to the resident (s) of the property as they are the affected consumer. a full lead service line replacement will require engagement and permission from the homeowner to enter their property to replace the customer owner portion of the lead service line and the connection inside the home , so they will be aware of the activity. the refore, the benefit of sending a letter within hours is very small compared to the effort expended by the water system to ensure it happens. . (f) and (g) - the proposed rule states “only full lead service line replacements count towards a wat er system’s annual replacement goal” or “mandatory replacement rate.” . dc water, under epa’s direction, conducted thousands of partial replacements when the lead action level was exceeded in . dc water currently has approximately , partial lead service lines that customers own on their private property . under the proposed rule, it is not clear if replacing these “past -partials” count s toward the required replacements. the regulation should not give an incentive to prioritize a full replacement o ver a partial replacement if both results in removal of are all remaining lead pipe. the water system should have the ability to create their own prioritization based on residents (e.g., pregnant mother or infant children present), homeowner input, or wate r system operations input. dc water recommends specifying that lead service line replacements which results in a full lead service line replacement, i.e., remove s all remaining lead pipe servicing a building , count towards the “replacement goal” or “manda tory replacement rate” whether the replacement is performed on the customer -owned portion or water system owned portion , or both. . (g)( ) - the proposed rule grants the state the discretion to shorten a water system’s replacement schedule. if epa wi ll require replacement of lead service lines, specifying the percent of service lines is appropriate; however, allowing for the state to determine any schedule is not appropriate as it hinders the ability for planning and for water systems to address other infrastructure needs. dc water recommends removing the provision to shorten the replacement schedule. public notification . (d) ( )(ii) - the proposed rule specifies that tap sample results with lead > ppb must be delivered to residence within hours. delivering within hours is challenging due to staff availability and the need to review results and letters prior to delivery. dc water has a robust quality assurance program that ensures the data from the laboratory are correctly uploaded to our database and printed letters have correct metals concentrations and addresses. dc water also operates a voluntary lead test program where any resident can reque st a lead test kit. we can receive results from a few hundred homes in one day. for homes with lead results of ppb or higher, we review the sample form, point -of-entry pipe information provided, past service line work conducted at the home, and any oth er service line material information prior to calling the customer so we can provide informative guidance about how to minimize their exposure to lead. consequently, time is needed to accurately process the data and properly communicate elevated lead resul ts and guidance to the residents. considering the samples were collected a month prior to receiving the results, and the health effects of lead differ from acute pathogen exposure , epa proposed lcr revis ions - docket id no. epa -hq-ow- - district of columbia water and sewer authority comments page additional time for qa/qc of the data is not only warranted, but needed . dc water recommends notifying within business days following the day the water system learns of the results. . (e)( ) - the proposed rule states that water systems that cause disturbance to a lead service line that results in the water being shut of f, and without conducting an lsr, must provide the consumer with information about the potential for elevated lead in water as a result of the disturbance as well as a flushing procedure to remove particulate lead. dc water agrees that the pipe scales can be disturbed when turning a valve on an individual service line, such as the shut of water for a meter changeout. however, water systems routinely shut off water to one or more blocks for maintenance activities and while the water in the service lines ma y have lower pressure, the pipe scales are not physically disturbed during the water main shut -off process. the regular opening and closing of faucets in the home , causes a water hammer effect that can generate more physical forces on the pipe wall than the reduction in water pressure due to the shut of a water main. dc water recommends epa clarify that the “water being shut off” situations are limited to those associated with operating a valve on an individual service line and r ecommended revision to . (e)( ) is “water systems that operate a valve on a lead service line without conducting an lead service line replacement , must provide the consumer with information about the potential for elevated lead in drinking water as a result of the disturbanc e as well as a flushing procedure to remove particulate lead. ” . (e)( )(ii) - the proposed rule includes the replacement of the water meter with the replacement of a gooseneck, pigtail, or connector for requiring the water system to provide a filter kit. the water meter setter is designed for easy replacement of the water meter. the two activities (water meter replacement and water meter setter replacement) should be addressed separately in the rule. the maintenance activity for replacing only the wa ter meter is to operate the shut -off valve(s) on either side of the water meter, unscrewing the couplings holding the meter, and replacing the meter. the replacement of the water meter only is covered in section . ( ) requiring notification of potenti al lead release , provision of water filters and instructions to flush. the replacement of a “water meter setter” is like the replacement of a portion of the service line such as gooseneck, pigtail, or connector, in terms of pipe scale disruption. dc water recommends epa revise the rule under . (e)( )(ii) to state “water meter setter” instead “water meter”. . (e)( )(iv) - the proposed rule states the water system must comply with the requirements before the consumer’s water is turned back on by t he water system. during repair and maintenance activities, the field workers must turn the water on and off successively to check for water leaks. therefore, the work might not be complete before the water is turned on if they see water leaking. provided the notice is only required for water shut -offs to individual service lines, dc water recommends that epa revise the language from “before the consumer’s water is turned on” to “immediately upon completion of the work .” . (h)( ) - the proposed rule states the water system must send annual notification to all customers with lsl by january . specifying a two -week window and the specific dates is epa proposed lcr revis ions - docket id no. epa -hq-ow- - district of columbia water and sewer authority comments page unnecessarily cumbersome for the water system. specific times of the year that are best for outreach diffe r by water system. for example, mailing around the holidays and the month of august results in a particularly poor response time. utilities must also plan for outreach activities in coordination with operations so the staff are able to respond to the incre ased inquiries from the mail outreach. dc water recommends that epa remove “by january ” from the rule. lcr sample pool . (a) - the proposed rule specifies that sites may not include faucets that have point -of-use (pou) or point -of-entry (poe) treatment devices. the proposed language infers that any home with a pou device on their kitchen faucet cannot be used in the sample pool, regardless of the potential of using another faucet in the home. dc water and most water systems are challenged to get customers to participate in the sampling program and the proposed language places an unnecessary restriction on eligible sample homes. dc water recommends the rule be revised to “sites may not include point -of-entry (poe) treatment devices and sample taps may not have pou devices”. . (a)( ) - the proposed rule states, “a water system that cannot find sufficient number of sampling sites served by lead service lines shall still collect samples from every site served by a lead service line,”. requiring water system to collect samples from “every” site served by a lead service line cannot be achieved. water systems do not have absolute control to obtain water samples from private property. dc water recommends the rule language be revised to add “attempt to” before “collect”. . (e) - the proposed rule states, “the results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the minimum requirements (such as customer -requested sampling) shall be considered by the system and the state in making any determinations (i.e., calculating the th percentile lead or copper level) under this subpart.” this rule language could be interpreted to mean the water system wou ld use samples collected from non -sample pool homes with lead service lines under any situation, i.e. not limited to only when the number collected from tier sites were less than the required number. larger water systems with free customer -request lead testing programs process a large number of samples. the review and acceptance criteria for non -lcr sample sites are not as stringent as the lcr compliance program. for example, the customer -requested sample form has only a few questions about collection t imes and one question asking if they checked their faucets for leaks. we process the non -lcr samples whether the customer follows the sampling procedures or not, even if the minimum six -hour stagnation is met by the times recorded , and we do not require an answer to the question regarding leaks. comparatively, our lcr sample form has three questions regarding leaks and stagnation in addition to the three questions about collection times and all questions must be answered. dc water recommends the rule more c learly specifies the circumstances which non -lcr samples would be used for the th percentile calculation and those circumstances be limited to only situations where insufficient samples were collected from tier or tier sites.
